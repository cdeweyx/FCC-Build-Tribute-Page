            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlung's life</h3>
            <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
            University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known
            as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
            <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more
            money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
            Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this
            left scars on me."</li>
            <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in
            the US Forestry Service</li>
            <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at
            Texas A&M University</li>
            <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the
            world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops
            are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable
            land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous
            because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals
            for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were
            selecting the best breeds."</li>
            <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
        </ul>
