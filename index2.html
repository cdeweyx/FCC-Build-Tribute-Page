        <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
            University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known
            as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
            <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more
            money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping
            starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said.
            "All of this left scars on me."</li>
            <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of
            wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a
            strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95%
            of Mexico's wheat.</li>
            <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at
            Texas A&M University</li>
            <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95</li>
        </ul>
